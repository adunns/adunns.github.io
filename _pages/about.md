I'm a New Zealand based computer science and information systems graduate with a passion for information security, specifically topics around penetration testing. I'm currently seeking a role to further develop my technical and business skills in the information security field. My short term goal is to gain the OSCP certification. Longer term, to work as a penetration tester.

At the same time, I'll be trying to learn as much as possible about the industry and the skills & tools I'll need to succeed. 

If I find something interesting or complete a project, I'll write about it.

Thanks for stopping by.

Aidan
